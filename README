Deep Q-Learning (DQN):

Deep Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning method that blends Q-learning with deep neural networks. Key features include:

Q-Learning:

Q-Learning finds optimal actions in a decision process by learning a Q-function (expected cumulative reward for each action in a given state).
Deep Neural Networks:

DQN employs deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function, enabling it to handle high-dimensional state spaces like images.
Experience Replay:

Experience Replay stores and randomly samples experiences, breaking temporal correlations and enhancing learning stability.
Target Network:

DQN uses two networks (online and target) to stabilize learning, updating the target network periodically.
Temporal Difference (TD) Error:

Training minimizes the TD error, the gap between predicted and target Q-values.
Exploration vs. Exploitation:

Epsilon-greedy strategy balances exploration and exploitation during learning.
DQN has proven effective in solving complex tasks like playing video games, though challenges like instability and hyperparameter tuning exist. Advanced variants like Double DQN address some of these issues.
